# Learning Zig by following the docs (and other resources)

In this repository are the files and notes I create while I learn Zig by
following its documentation and other resources I find on the web. As I learn
the features and concepts from Zig, I plan to document my understanding of them.

The Zig documentation is [here](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/).
